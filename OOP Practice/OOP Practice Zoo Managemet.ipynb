Use inheritance to create specific animal classes like Mammal, Bird, etc. Each should override a method unique_trait(). Create an abstract class Aquatic that inherits from Animal, and contains an abstract method swim. Create classes like Fish and Whale that inherit from Aquatic and implement the abstract method."
